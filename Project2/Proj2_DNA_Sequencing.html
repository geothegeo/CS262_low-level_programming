<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>CS262 Programming Assignment 2<br /> </b></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>DNA Sequencing<br /> </b></h2>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>For this assignment, you will be simulating the manipulation the nucleotides in strands of DNA.&nbsp; You do not need to know much about DNA to do this assignment, but if you would like to learn more about the process, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence">this webpage</a> has more information.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>A nucleotide base is a fundamental unit that creates a genetic code found in a DNA strand (RNA will be saved for a future project). These these bases are represented by four letters which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A for adenine</li>
<li>C for cytosine</li>
<li>G for guanine</li>
<li>T for thymine</li>
</ul>
<p>A chain of these nucleotide bases creates a Nucleic Acid which contains information used by living cells to construct proteins, which in turn contains the information that living organism need to survive and reproduce.&nbsp; The representation of these chains can be quite long.&nbsp; An example of such chains can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence#/media/File:AMY1gene.png">here</a>.&nbsp; As part of genetic engineering, these chains are cut, and a sequence from another organism is inserted, or perhaps a section of the chain is excised, or removed from the larger chain.</p>
<p>The program you write will simulate the splicing and chains of nucleotide bases. Since there are four different letters, each letter can be represented by two bits:</p>
<ul>
<li>A&nbsp; 00</li>
<li>C&nbsp; 01</li>
<li>G&nbsp; 10</li>
<li>T&nbsp; 11</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for example, the nucleotide sequence GATTACA can be represented by the number sequence 2033010 (or decimal 9156 or<span> binary 10 00 11 11 00 01 00).</span></p>
<p><span>You will be using bytes (unsigned char) to hold the nucleotide bases.&nbsp; Each byte can hold up to four letters.&nbsp; You will use bitwise operators (shifts, bitwise &amp;, |, ^, ~) to manipulate the bits in a byte to add, move, or change nucleotide letters.<br /> </span></p>
<p><b><br /> Specifications</b></p>
<p>Your program will use the following structure to hold a nucleotide chain:</p>
<p>#define MAX_CHAIN_BYTES&nbsp; 100<br /> <br /> typedef struct _Chain<br /> {<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; size_t&nbsp; SeqLen;&nbsp; // Number of letters in sequence<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unsigned char Sequence[MAX_CHAIN_BYTES];<br /> } Chain;</p>
<p>With this structure, a sequence can hold up to 400 different letters of a DNA sequence.&nbsp; The representation (and order) of the letters will be in the smallest to largest byte in the Sequence array.&nbsp; However, within a single byte, the letters will be ordered from Most Significant Bit (MSB - the leftmost bit) to Least Significant Bit (LSB - the rightmost bit).&nbsp; In other words, if a sequence contains just two letters - CT, then the representation of this sequence will be found in the first byte of the Sequence array (Sequence[0]), and will have the bit pattern&nbsp; 0111xxxx, where the x's can be either 0 or 1 since they will not be part of the overall sequence.&nbsp; (Note: Even though the unused bits can be either 0 or 1, you may find it advantageous to set them to 0.)</p>
<p>You are to write a menu driven program to alter (splice, excise, or replace) sequences. The menu will contain the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read a DNA sequence from a file</li>
<li>Save the current sequence to a file</li>
<li>Print the current sequence</li>
<li>Splice and insert a sub-sequence</li>
<li>Remove a sub-sequence</li>
<li>Replace a sub-sequence with another sub-sequence</li>
<li>Exit the program</li>
</ol>
<p>User input to the menu will consist of the numbers 1-7.&nbsp; Do not use any additional or different input values. Descriptions of the functionality of each input is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>When this option is selected, prompt the user to enter a filename containing a DNA sequence.&nbsp; This file will be in binary format, and contain the data for a single Chain structure.&nbsp; If the file can be opened successfully, the data in the file is used to initialize a variable of type Chain.&nbsp; Otherwise, an error message is written to the screen, and the program returns to the main menu.&nbsp; <b>Note: This option must be chosen before choosing options 2-6.&nbsp; You should check that a file was successfully read before allowing options 2-6 to be executed.</b></li>
<li>When this option is selected, prompt the user to enter a filename in which to save the data in the Chain struct containing the current sequence.&nbsp; The format of the file should be the same as described for option 1 (a single Chain structure in binary format).&nbsp; If the output file cannot be opened successfully, an error message is written to the screen, and the program returns to the main menu.</li>
<li>When this option is selected, the sequence of letters is printed to the screen.</li>
<li><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />When this option is selected, your program will prompt the user for two things:</li>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">The sub-sequence to insert - This will be a string of Nucleotide letters, and will be read from the console (not a file).&nbsp; Save this input in a Chain struct variable. (Note: Use strlen() to find the length of the input string, and DON'T forget to remove the trailing '\n').</li>
<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">The place to insert the sequence</li>
</ol></ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The sub-sequence will be placed after ALL instances of the given place to insert. For example:<br />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Suppose the current sequence is: CATAGGTACCAGGTACA</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The sequence to insert is: ACATGA<br /> The place to insert is:&nbsp; GGT</div>
Your program will search for <b>all</b> instances of GGT (shown in <b>bold</b>) in the current sequence<br />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">CATA<b>GGT</b>ACCA<b>GGT</b>ACA</div>
and insert the sub-sequence (shown in lower case for this example) after each of those instances:<br />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">CATA<b>GGT</b>acatagaACCA<b>GGT</b>acatagaACA</div>
So, the result after this insertion will be:</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">CATAGGTACATGAACCAGGTACATGAACA</div>
<br />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Note:&nbsp; If the sub-sequence happens to contain the subsequence after which to insert, it will NOT be included in the insertion (What can happen if it <b>is</b> included as the place to insert?)</div>
<ol></ol><ol>
<li value="5">When this option is selected, your program will prompt the user for a sub-sequence.&nbsp; This sub-sequence will be entered from the console (not a file).&nbsp; Your program will then search for the given sub-sequence throughout the entire current sequence and remove ALL instances of the given sub-sequence.&nbsp; For example, if the current sequence is:</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">CATA<b>GGTA</b>CATGAACCA<b>GGTA</b>CATGAACA</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">and the entered sub-sequence is:<br />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">GGTA</div>
the resulting sequence is:<br />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">CATACATGAACCACATGAACA</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<ol>
<li value="6">When this option is selected, your program will prompt the user for a sub-sequence to remove.&nbsp; This sub-sequence will be entered from the console (not a file).&nbsp; The program will then prompt the user for a sub-sequence to replace the removed sub-sequence. This sub-sequence will also be entered from the console. Note that the two sequences do not necessarily have to be the same length.&nbsp; Your program will then search for the first sub-sequence throughout the entire current sequence and replace ALL instances of this sub-sequence with the second sub-sequence.&nbsp; For example, if the current sequence is:</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">CATA<b>GGTA</b>CATGAACCA<b>GGTA</b>CATGAACA<br /> the sub-sequence to remove is:</div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;">GGTA</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">and the replacement sub-sequence is:<br />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">AACGTGA</div>
the resulting sequence is:<br /> CATA<b>AACGTGA</b>CATGAACCA<b>AACGTGA</b>CATGAACA</div>
<ol>
<li value="7">If this option is selected, print an appropriate closing message, and exit the program.</li>
</ol>
<p>As in past assignments, part of the grading of your code will be performed by a script (sample scripts will be provided), and any additional or missing prompts will cause your program to fail to run correctly.</p>
<p><b>Other Specifications and Additional Information</b></p>
<ul>
<li>You must include a Makefile to compile your project.</li>
<li>Portions of the project will be graded using a script (a sample will be provided).&nbsp; It is important that your program works with any sample scripts.&nbsp; Otherwise, your overall score for the project may be lowered considerably.</li>
<li>If the size of the original sequence plus a modification is greater than the maximum length of a sequence, truncate the end of the sequence so that it is no longer than 4 * MAX_CHAIN_BYTES.</li>
<li>For options 4, 5, and 6, if the entered sub-sequence (for replacement, removal, or insertion after) cannot be found in the current sequence, the sequence should not be modified, and an informational message (such as "sub-sequence not found") should be printed to the screen.</li>
<li>If an input sequence that is read from the console contains any characters other than A, C, G, or T, print an error message and re-prompt for a new sequence until a correct sequence is entered.</li>
<li>Data in the binary files is assumed to be correct (by nature of the previous two bullets).</li>
<li>As always, the use of global variables and variable length arrays are forbidden.</li>
<li>All source and tarfiles should follow the standard CS262 naming conventions and contain appropriate comments.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some Helpful Hints:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Although the data must be read and written from/to the files in binary format, you can perform most of the other operations using cstrings.&nbsp; However, you will have to convert the data from or to binary when reading or writing the files.</li>
<li>You may find the following String Library functions useful (check man pages for proper usage):</li>
<ul>
<li>strstr()</li>
<li>strcpy()</li>
<li>strlen()</li>
<li>strcat()</li>
</ul>
<li>You can index within portions of a string by using the &amp; (Address-of) operator.&nbsp; For example, to remove the 7th and 8th character from a string named str using strcpy, you can use the following function call:</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">strcpy(&amp;str[6], &amp;str[8]);</div>
<ul>
<li>Strategic use of the NULL character ('\0') after copying sequences to temporary cstrings may help with insertion and deletion of sub-sequences.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Testing and Submitting:</span><br /> Test your program on Zeus to make sure it compiles and runs properly in various types of cases. Perform appropriate error checking.</p>
<p>Create a tarfile that contains your source code and Makefile, and all other files used for your project.</p>
<p>Submit this tarfile to Blackboard no later than 11:59 p.m., April 8, 2018.</p>
<br />
<p><b>Errata and Updates:</b></p>
<p>3/19/18 - Added following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1 must be chosen before options 2-6 can be executed</li>
<li>If a sub-sequence does not exist in the current sequence, the sequence is left unmodified, and an informational message is printed to the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>3/22/18 - Changed data type of Sequence array in Chain struct from char to unsigned char.</p>
<p>3/24/18 - Removed statement in Option 4&nbsp;of saving input sub-sequence as a Chain struct.</p>
